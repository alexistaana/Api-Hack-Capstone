Description

An app that lets the user search for meetups within the searched area. Additionally showing light food and or drink places around the meetup area.

Motivation
---
I wanted to make an app that makes it easier for people looking for meetups and at the same time have a place to go after the meetup
in case they want to grab something to eat or drink or even hang out with people from the meetup.
